# Highcharts and JavaScript (Assignment 8)

This repo contains your assignment starter files, including the [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/blog/products/highcharts/) code from the [download page](https://www.highcharts.com/blog/download/).

Highcharts code version: 10.2.1 (updated October 17, 2022, at 5:11 p.m.).

You will not need to use those files, however, because you can use a CDN instead. This is the method in your example file, *test_check.html*. What is a CDN? It is a **content delivery network** where files (such as the Highcharts library) can be linked to by you or anyone. A CDN usually means faster load times for all users of your website. [Highcharts hosts its own CDN.](https://code.highcharts.com/)

## Instructions: How to complete the assignment

All instructions for the assignment are [in this document](http://bit.ly/mm-webapps8).

If you forgot how to **fork and clone** a GitHub repo, how to create a *gh-pages* **branch,** or how to **commit and push,** [see these instructions](https://github.com/macloo/github-howto-and-github-desktop).

### A file you will not use in the assignment

* *scripts_local.html* is identical to *test_check.html* except in one respect: *scripts_local.html* uses LOCAL files to load the Highcharts code. The other file (*test_check.html*) uses a **CDN,** meaning the Highcharts files it uses are online.

If you needed to work on your assignment without Internet access, you could use the local files as shown in *scripts_local.html*.

You can view any of the HTML files by simply opening them in your browser.
